# Project Memory

## Core
BM default brand. Multi-office branding (logo, watermark) via app_settings.
Admin/Vault master password: "01278006248" (editable via UI). Owner user: maka.
Phone number is unique customer ID; new orders update existing customer data.
Financial updates and status reversals MUST use DB Triggers to prevent double deduction.
Never hard-delete users or products; use NULL references to preserve financial history.
Agent reporting strictly uses `assigned_at`. Net Profit = (Products + Customer Shipping) - Agent Shipping.
Order reverted to Pending/Processing automatically clears `delivery_agent_id`.
Simplified checkout: DO NOT add discount, extra shipping, or prepaid shipping fields.
